      <div class="first-par"><h4>My name is Wandile Anderson Khowa, I am 21 years old and I was born and bred in South Africa's second biggest township - Umlazi. It is located in the East side of KZN's town called Durban. Being raised in a township is not the easiest of environments to grow up in but I managed to come out unscathed. I went to a primary school called Khuthala Junior Primary School. It is a 10 minute walk from my house and almost all my friends went to the same school so I was overjoyed when I attended my first class.<br><br>After 4th grade, my parents moved me to a former model-C school - <a href="http://www.fsps.co.za/">Fynnlands Senior Primary School</a> - in persuit of better education. It succeeded because I managed to pick up a reasonable work-ethic and saw the importance of having high grades. At this age, I was convinced I was going to be a teacher because of how funny and intelligent I thought my mathematics teacher was.</h4>

      <div class="second-par"><h4>I attended high in a school called <a href="http://www.umlazicomtech.co.za/">Umlazi Comprehensive Technical High School</a> which is a school in the township. I disliked this downgrade haveing come from a better school but I did not challenge my parents' judgement as they always want what is best for me. I was a below average student when I was in 8th grade and 9th grade. My fortunes changed when I came a book called The Secret. This book changed my thinking and my whole perception of life.<br> <br>I began pushing my limits and striving for more. I made in to the top five in my class in 10th grade and from there onwards, I finished top of my school. At the end of my matric year, I was the top student in Mathematics and Physics in my province! Having passionate teachers with a high work-ethic contributed a lot towards my achiments</h4>

      <div class="third-par"><h4>It was always my dream to attend at the best university in Africa and after I got my matric results, I received an SMS from te <a href="http://www.uct.ac.za/">University of Cape Town</a> notifying me that I had been accepted to study Computer Science there. I like everything about Cape Town and the people there apart from the weather. I am currently in my final year of study and I am looking to go on to honours next year.<br> <br>I have learned a lot since coming to the university, they have world class lecturers with A-ratings. There were a few disruptions to my academics in the year 2016 when there were demonstrations of dissatisfaction in my university concerning the statue of Cecil John Rhodes and also dissatisfaction about the high fees' rates in universities across South Africa.</h4>
